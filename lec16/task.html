<b>A Little Adventure… An Epically Muddy Day at<br> the Dead Sea</b>

<pre>
Last updated on January 2, 2023

After arriving at the <b>Dead Sea</b> in Jordan, I wasn’t prepared for the sheer starkness of
the landscape. My previously conjured images of the Dead Sea were of two varieties:

	- An exotic, remote, and barren desert landscape with an inhospitable lake of
	water stretching for miles.
	- A smiling and slightly accented vendor in any one of America’s super-sized malls
	rubbing dark brown Dead Sea mud onto the back of my hand, extolling its many
	virtues.

Neither version prepared me for the actuality of the <b>Dead Sea</b>—the region’s bare
landscape was the very element lending beauty. And remote? Not hardly. It’s a mere 45
minute drive from <a href="https://alittleadrift.com/amman-citadel-temple-of-hercules/" target="_blank">Amman</a>, Jordan’s capital, and surrounded by a handful of significant
religious biblical and Islamic pilgrimage sites. We easily added an overnight here
between our exploring the myths and history of Petra and a <a href="task2.html" target="_blank">sunrise camel ride in Wadi 
Rum.</a>

<b style="color:#539ED6">Why is the Dead Sea So Important?</b>

The <b>Dead Sea</b> is a salt lake located in the Jordan Rift Valley and is bordered by Jordan
to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west. It’s a popular tourist spot because of its
unique ecosystem and the many health benefits that are believed to be associated with
its high salt and mineral content. The <b>Dead Sea</b> is also an important source of natural
minerals and is home to a number of industries that rely on its resources.
