<b>A Little Inspiration… A Pastel Sunrise Over<br> Wadi Rum</b>

The gentle vibrations from my iPhone slowly cut the last thin thread of dreams
separating me from consciousness as I pulled myself awake. Looking at the gaps in my
tent wall showed just the faintest tint of color lightening the morning sky. The dead
silence surrounding me at the desert camp in <b>Wadi Rum</b>, Jordan invited me to curl
back into my heavy blanket and claim another hour of sleep—5:00am seems barely
human for a wake up call.

My iPhone was on to me though, and just as my eyelids drifted closed the alarm’s
insistent buzzing woke me once again. Oh yeah,  how could I have forgotten? A sunrise
camel ride through the desert!
