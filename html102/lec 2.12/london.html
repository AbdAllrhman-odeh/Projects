			History
		</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			The Romans built the city of Londinium along the River Thames in AD 43. The name Londinium (and later 'London') came from the Celtic language of the Ancient Britons. In AD 61, the city was attacked and destroyed. Then the Romans rebuilt the city, and London became an important trading hub.

			<b>5th century: end of Roman rule to 12th century</b>
		<p>
			After the decline of the Roman Empire, few people remained in London. The Anglo-Saxon people of Sub-Roman Britain were mainly agricultural. Once the Romans had gone, trade with Continental Europe dwindled. In the 9th century, more people started living in London again. It became the largest city in England. However, it did not become the capital city of England again until the 12th century. For a long time after the Romans, England was not unified, and so had no capital.
		</p>
			<b>17th century</b>
		<p>
			The 17th century saw Londoners suffer from the plague and the fire of London. The century starts with the famous Gunpowder Plot.
