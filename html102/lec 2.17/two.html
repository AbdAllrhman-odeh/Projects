			From the ancient wonders to the beautiful landscapes, Jordan is a cinematographer’s paradise. That’s probably why so many iconic movies were filmed here.
			Watch the famous Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and you’ll recognise the stunning Treasury at Petra. Or watch Lawrence of Arabia, The Martian, or Red Planet, and you’ll see the magical mountains, cliffs, and desert lunar landscapes of Wadi Rum.

			Amman is the capital city of Jordan, but that’s not its only claim to fame. The city sits on the site of Ain Ghazal, one of the world’s largest Neolithic settlements with a history dating back to the Stone Age. The statues found at this site are some of the world’s oldest, dating back to 7500 B.C.

		<p>
			Cancel your next trip to the day spa and visit the Dead Sea instead! Not only can you soothe your sore muscles by floating in the salty water, but you’ll also feel very calm here as bromine, a natural sedative, evaporates from the water.
