			As one of the oldest cities in the world and one of the New 7 Wonders of the World, the UNESCO-listed Petra is one spectacular site in Jordan. It’s up there with the most visited attractions in Jordan, yet only 15% of this ancient city’s maze of temples, facades and tombs have been explored.

		<p>
			One of the most interesting facts about Jordan is that, at 420 metres below sea level, the Dead Sea here is the lowest point on Earth. But that’s not the only magical thing about this place. The water in the Dead Sea is ten times saltier than ocean water, which makes you extra buoyant so you float on top of the water.
