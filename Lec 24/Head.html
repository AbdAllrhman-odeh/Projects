<b style="color:red; font-family:Cursive; margin-left:40px;">The human head </b>consists of a fleshy outer portion, which surrounds
 the bony skull. The brain is enclosed within the skull. There are 22 bones in the human
 head. The head rests on the neck, and the seven cervical vertebrae support it.
 The human head typically weighs between 2.3 and 5 kilograms (5.1 and 11.0 lb) Over 98% of
 humans fit into this range. There have been odd incidences where human beings have
 abnormally small or large heads. The Zika virus was responsible for underdeveloped
 heads in the early 2000s.
 
 The face is the anterior part of the head, containing the eyes, nose, and mouth.
 On either side of the mouth, the cheeks provide a fleshy border to the oral cavity.
 The ears sit to either side of the head.
 <h4>Blood supply</h4>
<b style="color:red; font-family:Cursive; margin-left:40px;">The head</b> receives blood supply through the internal and external carotid arteries.
 These supply the area outside of the skull (external carotid artery) and inside of the
 skull (internal carotid artery). The area inside the skull also receives blood supply from
 the vertebral arteries, which travel up through the cervical vertebrae.
 <h4>Nerve supply</h4>
	The twelve pairs of cranial nerves provide the majority of nervous control to the head. The sensation to the face is provided by the branches of the trigeminal nerve, the fifth
 cranial nerve. Sensation to other portions of the head is provided by the cervical nerves.
 
 Modern texts are in agreement about which areas of the skin are served by which nerves, but there are minor variations in some of the details. The borders designated by diagrams
 in the 1918 edition of Gray's Anatomy are similar but not identical to those generally accepted today.
<h4>The cutaneous innervation of the head is as follows:</h4>
<em style="color:green;">- Ophthalmic nerve </em>
<em style="color:pink;">- Maxillary nerve</em>
<em style="color:yellow;">- Mandibular nerve</em>
<em style="color:purple;">-Cervical plexus</em>
<em style="color:blue;">-Dorsal rami of cervical nerves</em> and others are in picture which show following in upper column
