<b style="color:gray; font-family:Cursive;">The foot (pl: feet)</b> is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates.
 It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion.
 In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate[clarification needed] organ at the
 terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including 
 claws or nails.

The human foot is a strong and complex mechanical structure containing 26 bones,
 33 joints (20 of which are actively articulated), and more than a hundred muscles,
 tendons, and ligaments. The joints of the foot are the ankle and subtalar joint and 
 the interphalangeal joints of the foot. An anthropometric study of 1197 North American
 adult Caucasian males (mean age 35.5 years) found that a man's foot length was 26.3 cm
 with a standard deviation of 1.2 cm.

The foot can be subdivided into the hindfoot, the midfoot, and the forefoot:

The hindfoot is composed of the talus (or ankle bone) and the calcaneus (or heel bone).
 The two long bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula, are connected to the top of
 the talus to form the ankle. Connected to the talus at the subtalar joint, the calcaneus,
 the largest bone of the foot, is cushioned underneath by a layer of fat.

The five irregular bones of the midfoot, the cuboid, navicular, and three cuneiform bones,
 form the arches of the foot which serves as a shock absorber. The midfoot is connected to
 the hind- and fore-foot by muscles and the plantar fascia.

The forefoot is composed of five toes and the corresponding five proximal long bones forming
 the metatarsus. Similar to the fingers of the hand, the bones of the toes are called
 phalanges and the big toe has two phalanges while the other four toes have three phalanges
 each. The joints between the phalanges are called interphalangeal and those between the
 metatarsus and phalanges are called metatarsophalangeal (MTP).

Both the midfoot and forefoot constitute the dorsum (the area facing upward while standing)
 and the planum (the area facing downward while standing).

The instep is the arched part of the top of the foot between the toes and the ankle.
