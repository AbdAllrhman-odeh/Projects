<b style="color:gray; font-family:Cursive;">A hand</b> is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at
 the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys,
 and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs
 on each "hand" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often
 described as having "hands" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is
 usually described as having "hands" though opposable thumbs are lacking.

Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on
 the forelimb more generallyâ€”for example, in the context of whether the three digits
 of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.

<b style="color:gray; font-family:Cursive;">The human hand</b> usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often
 referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one
 of the fingers. It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number
 of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges 
 (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb.
 The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist.
 Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.
