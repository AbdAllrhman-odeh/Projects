<img style="float:right; display:inline; margin-right:20px;" width="500px" height="500px" src="C:\Users\aboodOdeh\Desktop\BeProgrammer\lec\html-css 101\lec 24\image\ears1.jpg">
The <b style="color:brown; font-family:Cursive;">human ear</b> consists of three parts—<ins>the <a href="#o">outer ear</a>, <a href="#m">middle ear</a> and <a href="#i">inner ear</a>.</ins>
 The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity of the middle
 ear by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the
 transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal
 opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and
 saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea
 of the auditory system.
<h4 id="o">Outer ear</h4>
<b style="color:brown; font-family:Cursive;">The outer ear</b> is the external portion of the ear and includes the fleshy visible pinna
 (also called the auricle), the ear canal, and the outer layer of the eardrum
 (also called the tympanic membrane).

The pinna consists of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called
 the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures
 the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus.
<h4 id="m">Middle ear</h4>
<b style="color:brown; font-family:Cursive;">The middle ear</b> lies between the outer ear and the inner ear. It consists of an air-filled
 cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments;
 the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that
 function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear.
 The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup).
 The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper
 throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.
 <h4 id="i">Inner ear</h4>
 <b style="color:brown; font-family:Cursive;">The inner ear</b> sits within the temporal bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth.
 A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses,
 the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea.
 There are three semicircular canals angled at right angles to each other which are
 responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for
 the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.
